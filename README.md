# FsScheme

A basic Scheme-subset interpreter written in F#.

## Motivation

I have been intended to learn about functional programming and compiler writing for a while. I have done the [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 hours by Jonathan Tang](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours.pdf) but never has the feel for the language. This is a second attempt, in F#.

## Credit

The project is done by porting [Write Yourself a Scheme, version 2.0 by Adam Wespiser](https://www.wespiser.com/writings/wyas/00_overview.html) from Haskell to F#, with reference to [the "original" port by Luca Bolognese](https://lucabolognese.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/write-yourself-a-scheme-in-48-hours-in-f-part-i/)
